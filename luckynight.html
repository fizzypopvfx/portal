				<h2 class="video-title">Skinned Animation Textures</h2>
				<div class="description">
					<p>This scene shows many varying skinned animations. To achieve this with instancing a python script
						recorded the bone matrices for each frame of the animation from an FBX. Matrices were then written
						to a texture and passed as a uniform to a vertex shader.</p>
	
					<p>The bone matrix values could then be read in any order to offset/speed/slow the animation depending
						on the instance. Several animations could be used efficiently by one shader in one render call.</p>

				<h2 class="video-title">Character Creation &amp; Animation Workflow</h2>
				<div class="description">
					<p>Members of the band '<a href="https://bisnation.com/" target="_blank">bis</a>' were scanned using the
						In3D app to provide an approximation of their likeness for this video. Scans were tidied up in
						Blender. Finer details, clothing, and accessories were added, including textures developed in
						Photoshop. Each model was exported with a baked texture atlas for ease of use in TouchDesigner.
						Models were then auto-rigged with Mixamo and put back into Blender for fine tuning. Using a Mixamo
						rig later made it very easy to hot swap animations during development. This workflow allowed me to
						test animations in context to make creative decisions quickly.</p>

				<h2 class="video-title">Depth of Field &amp; Fake Emissive Lighting</h2>
				<div class="description">
					<p>Depth of field is applied as a post process using the depth buffer and a blur. The amount of blur is
						scaled by the depth of the scene. This allows narrative elements to be brought in and out of focus.
					</p>
					<p>Similarly, the 'Lucky Night' sign is rendered separately, blurred, and composite over to create a
						glowing effect. A purple light is placed nearby to approximate the illumination the sign would
						provide to characters and surroundings in lieu of real emissive lighting in TouchDesigner.</p>

				<h2 class="video-title">Instancing &amp; Video Feedback</h2>
				<div class="description">
					<p>This scene made use of video feedback and instancing to create a variety of fun dance scenarios with
						these characters. The background uses random colours generated by simplex noise. These simple
						techniques allowed me to build interesting psychedelic scenes quickly.</p>

				<h2 class="video-title">90s Club Environment</h2>
				<div class="description">
					<p>The outer shell of the club environment was built in Blender. Interior details were added
						procedurally including lights, glasses, tables, chairs and bar taps. These were later textured with
						PBR materials. Cone lights were added outside to simulate those of a city street. Internal lights
						did not match up to models but instead provided a general atmosphere. A projected texture was used
						to emulate disco ball reflections.</p>
