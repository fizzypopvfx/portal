				<div class="description">
					<ul>
						<li>Particles cause vertex displacement on a plane at the location of impact.</li>
						<li>Rain drops are managed by a GLSL compute shader using simplex noise to generate start
							locations
							on a plane above the water surface.</li>
						<li>Drops are animated using a gravity force which nicely allows for directional rain. Drops are
							looped as they intersect with the ground. Intersection locations are
							output to a separate
							texture of 'puddle points'.</li>
						<li>Puddle points are used to instance circles viewed above with an orthogonal camera and output
							to
							a new render target.</li>
						<li>A heightmap is drawn using video feedback, edge detection, and Catmull-Rom blurring to
							create
							rippling effects from the rendered circles.</li>
						<li>A modified PBR material shader displaces the water surface using the heightmap.</li>

				<div class="description">
					<p>A cheap and easy dolphin swimming animation. A sine wave is applied along the length (z-axis) of
						the
						mesh driven by time to move vertices. Fins are animated by scaling a rotation by the vertex
						x-axis
						values. This moves the tips of the fins most and the body the least. Animation is offset by
						instance
						ID. Built on a GPU Boids simulation by <a href="https://dirt.design/portfolio/touchdesigner-boids/

				<div class="description">
					<p>Procedurally modelled jellyfish. A sphere mesh is trimmed to 75&percnt; size. Six cylinders are
						shaped into cones. Vertex attributes are added to the separate pieces to later identify them in
						the
						vertex shader. The shader then applies pulse and wiggle animations to specific pieces at varying
						frequencies to create a dynamic smack of jellyfish.</p>

				<div class="description">
					<p>A green-screened performer mimics playful interaction in an underwater world.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Fish are modelled in Blender, their tails animate using a vertex shader and a combination of
							high and low frequency sine waves to approximate swimming motions.</li>
						<li>Plants are alembics with pulsing vertex animation to add more life and character. Bubbles
							are
							mesh-instanced particle systems with upward force and turbulence.</li>
						<li>Post effects include colour grading, uv displacement, GLSL god rays (adapted), and projected
							noise
							textures that simulate caustics.</li>

				<h2 class="video-title">Alien Garden - Heightmaps Displacement, Vertex Bending &amp; Alembics</h2>
				<div class="description">
					<ul>
						<li>The ground transitions from a flat black plane to pink rolling hills using animated
							heightmaps,
							creating fluid transitions between different worlds.</li>
						<li>Grass geometry is instanced then animated with a simple bend. The amount of rotation applied
							to
							a vertex is dependent on its height. Similar animations are applied to the other plants.
						</li>
						<li>An alembic tree grows along a curve. The underside of its geometry is sprinkled with
							positions
							to instance flat shaded fruit, blowing in the wind using generative rotation.</li>
						<li>Motes of dust float about the scene. These are instanced low-poly spheres drawn to a render
							target, blurred, then composite over the scene.</li>

				<h2 class="video-title">Foot Tracking &amp; Depth Correction</h2>
				<div class="description">
					<p>To apply 2D chroma-keyed footage to a 3D world convincingly, the performer's feet had to be
						detected
						and effectively clamped to the ground plane. The performer would otherwise float above the
						ground
						when stepping backwards.</p>
					<p>This is achieved by first detecting the lowest non-transparent pixel in the feed. The performer
						is
						rendered to a rectangle in a separate scene. By shooting a ray at the UV of the lowest point,
						the
						closest intersection along the ray to the ground in front or behind the performer can be found.
						Moving the performer to this location (with some scaling) creates a convincing effect of
						grounding
						the character in the final scene.

						expert
						knowledge on this ðŸ’œ</p>

				<div class="description">
					<ul>
						<li>
							Three audio stems (guitar, bass, drums) are visualised as colourful audio-reactive trees in
							a
							forest.
						</li>
						<li>
							Audio data is resampled to 30hz. Amplitude is used for positioning in one dimension to
							instance
							small hexagonal geometry. A wave is multiplied along the sampling window to scale down
							amplitude
							at each end of the tree.
						</li>
						<li>
							Screen-space reflections are used on the ground plane to add depth and polish to the scene.

				<h2 class="video-title">Particles, Forces, and Audio-Reactivity</h2>
				<div class="description">
					<p>A particle system is influenced by a rotating force around the performer to create an upward
						swirling
						effect. Particles scale in size based on the power of the drum sounds, connecting audio and
						visual elements as the performance draws to a close.
					</p>
					<p>Volumetric fog and light rays are added as post effects to give depth to the scene. Swirling
						green
						clouds are composite with post effects to simulate mild aurora and colour the glow around the
						sun.

				<h2 class="video-title">Generative Paths</h2>
				<div class="description">
					<p>The birds and camera in this scene follow the same path however, they are randomly offset from
						each
						other using generative noise. The travel speed of the camera and birds are also randomly
						adjusted
						over to give the impression of a more 'human' camera operator, simulating a behaviour commonly
						seen
						in this type of footage.</p>

				<div class="description">
					<p>Video frames are streamed into a 3D texture, each layer within the texture is then instanced
						closely
